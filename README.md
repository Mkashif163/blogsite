Project Description: Blog Site

The Blog Site project is a web application built using Node.js and Express framework. It provides a platform for users to create, read, and share blog posts. The project incorporates a MongoDB database for storing and retrieving blog data.

The project utilizes several key dependencies, including Express, Body-parser, EJS, Lodash, and Mongoose. Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web applications. Body-parser is used to parse the incoming request bodies, while EJS is the chosen template engine for rendering dynamic HTML content. Lodash provides utility functions for working with arrays, objects, and strings. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and provides a straightforward way to interact with the MongoDB database.

The blog site consists of different routes and views to handle various functionalities. The home route ("/") displays the home page, which contains the starting content of the blog and a list of existing posts. The "about" route ("/about") displays information about the blog or the website. The "contact" route ("/contact") provides contact information or a contact form. The "compose" route ("/compose") allows users to create new blog posts. The "posts" route ("/posts/:postId") displays the full content of a specific post when accessed with its unique ID.

When a user creates a new post using the "compose" route, the data is stored in the MongoDB database using the defined post schema. The post data includes a title and content. Upon saving the post, the application redirects the user back to the home page ("/") where the newly created post is displayed.

Overall, the Blog Site project provides a user-friendly interface for managing and displaying blog content. It allows users to create, view, and interact with blog posts, promoting content sharing and engagement within a blogging community.
